     * !!!!!!!!!! PLEASE READ THIS IN DETAIL TO SEE HOW REAL-TIME SAFETY VERIFICATION FOR DISTRIBUTED SYSTEMS WORK
     *
     * Each agent run faceLifting method locally, it computes forwardly the the reachable set (a convex hull)
     * from its current time (start-time) to future time an amount of time called reachTime, i.e. [current-time, future-time],
     * future-time - current-time = reachTime
     *
     * The reachable set computation need to be done within an certain amount of time called runTime << reachTime. (this is where
     * the iteratively improved face-lifting method takes places by changing step-size in doing face-lifting).
     *
     * The reachable set (a convex hull) is then put in its given protected queue with a given time-stamp, i.e.,
     * the time in which the reachable set is valid. The time-stamp is done using the local agent time.
     *
     * A central analyzer will read the reachable sets of all agents from all queues and analyze the safety based on distributed reachable set analysis method
     *
     * Note that there are mismatches between local times of the agents. Assume that the clock of these agents are synchronized up to some accuracy
     *
     * A formal method need to deal with these mismatches to have a formal guarantee about the safety of the distributed system.

    /**
     * The safety of the distributed system is predicted from a global current-time to a global future-time
     *
     * This safety checking includes two parts:
     *
     * 1) check if an agent reach some obstacles when moving. These obstacles are assumed to be static and immobile.
     *
     * This check is done locally by the agent its self since it is assumed to known the locations of the obstacles.
     * This check is done simultaneously when the agent do face-lifting by checking the intersection between its reach set with unsafe region
     *
     * 2) check if agents are collided with each other. This is done by a global (central) analyzer. This global analyzer will
     * read all reachable set of all agents from their corresponding queues.
     *
     * The distributed reach set analysis is done from these reachable sets having time-stamps mismatches.
